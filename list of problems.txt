- How do you verify if a given tree is a binary search tree.  
- Add and Delete an element from a binary search tree
- Given an array of positive and negative numbers, most efficient way to cluster all negative numbers on the left and all positives on the right.
- Given a map with binary values 0 and 1, how can you find the largest cluster of 1?
- Given a binary tree, print out the nodes by levels.
- Implement a string to integer function.  
- find the same element in two arrays 
- Given a binary tree, verify that it's a BST  
- Validate a BST; from post, pre and in order traversals make the tree given, solve for the sqrt, which is the best time to buy and sell a stock  
- Given an array with the elements of the nodes of a binary tree with random order(each node has filed of children but no parent), given a node in the array, find all its parent.
- Reverse a string
- Check whether a given string has valid parentheses. For example, { needs to match }, ( matches ) and [ matches ]. And you have to check whether they are in the right order. The follow-up question is to check the valid string again but with given pairs. Say the pairs are "ab cd". That means 'a' needs to match 'b' and 'c' needs tomatch 'd'.  
- designing a data structure that stores counts of words in a text file as well as every line.  
- As LRU in leetcode, design data structure to implement the functions. Get prices of company as time. The prices of companies may change any time. Get top 5 company who have more price than others.
- Develop a heap class that supports max()  
- How would you know if a double has four decimal places?
- How do you know there exist two numbers in a given array which add up to be a certain number? (given: array, target sum, return: true or false)  
- Perform and print level order traversal of a binary tree
- Add 2 numbers whose digits are stored in a linked list, i.e. add(1->2->3->4, 4->5->6->7) is equivalent to adding 1234 + 4567.
